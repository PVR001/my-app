This React component, HTMLCSSLogo, renders a stylized HTML & CSS logo inside an SVG graphic. Here's a brief explanation:

SVG Graphic:

The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) creates a rotated square using the <path> element, with colored lines on its edges.
Four lines form the square's border, each with a different color.
There are two pieces of text inside the square: one displays "HTML&CSS" in bold, and the other shows "design and build websites" below it.
Styling:

The entire logo is centered on the screen using Flexbox (logo-container), with a dark background (#292929).
The size of the logo is fixed at 256px by 256px.
The component uses inline JSX styles for layout and design, and svg for scalable vector graphics
